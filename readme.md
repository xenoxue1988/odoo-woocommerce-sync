## Description

The **Odoo-WooCommerce Sync** add-on enables synchronization between WooCommerce and Odoo. The main features are:

- **WooCommerce to Odoo:** Synchronize new and existing products (including variations), stock quantity levels, customers, and orders (including line items).
- **Odoo to WooCommerce:** Synchronize new and existing products (including variations) and stock quantity levels.
- **Extended Models and Views:** Enhance existing Odoo models and views for `product.template`, `product.product`, `res.partner`, `sale.order`, and `sale.order.line` to accommodate corresponding WooCommerce REST API fields.
- **Automated and Manual Synchronization:** A built-in cron job scheduler enables regular synchronization, complemented by a dedicated button for manually triggering updates.
- **Advanced Settings:** Support for multiple WooCommerce websites with specific configuration options for each instance (e.g. syncing only products from WooCommerce to Odoo).
- **Image Synchronization:** Optionally synchronize product images from WooCommerce to Odoo. For products imported from WooCommerce that include multiple images/product gallery, an additional photo gallery tab is added to the `product.template` view.
- **Language Filtering:** Synchronize products by language (*requires Polylang*).
- **Orders Transactions Fee Support:** Integrates additional fee fields into orders processed with PayPal and Stripe (*requires the respective plugins*).

Some features require additional setup, as detailed in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

> [!WARNING]
> This add-on is provided without any warranty and may contain bugs as it is a recently developed solution. Testing in a controlled environment is recommended before deployment, and usage is at one's own risk.

## Limitations

- **Performance:** Updating product variations may take long, as each variable product is processed through a separate WooCommerce REST API call.
- **Stock Management:** If a WooCommerce product variation's "Manage Stock" setting is modified, the corresponding parent product in Odoo is removed. This requires a complete re-import of the parent product and its variations, which can be manually retriggered by pressing the `Sync Now` button.
- **Unique SKU Requirement:** Every product must have a unique SKU. For product variations, both the parent product and each individual variation must possess a SKU. In Odoo, the internal reference field (`default_code`) should be used to store this value.
- **Media Endpoints:** The WooCommerce REST API does not provide direct access to media endpoints; therefore, uploading images from Odoo to WooCommerce is not supported in this add-on.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Odoo-WooCommerce Sync add-on:

1. **Install Python Dependencies:** Ensure the [Python dependencies](#python-dependencies) are installed on the Odoo instance.
2. **Enable Odoo Add-ons:** Install and activate all [required](#odoo-add-ons-required) and, if applicable, [optional](#odoo-add-ons-optional) Odoo add-ons.
3. **Configure WordPress (if applicable):** Install and set up the [optional plugins](#wordpress-plugins-optional) for WordPress. Retrieve the WooCommerce REST API `consumer key` and `consumer secret` from `WooCommerce` > `Settings` > `Advanced` > `REST API`.
4. **Add the Add-on:** Download and place the [`woocommerce_sync`](./woocommerce_sync) directory into the Odoo `addons` directory.
5. **Activate Debug Mode:** Log in to Odoo and enable [Debug Mode](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/developer_mode.html).
6. **Update the Apps List:** Navigate to `Home Menu` > `Apps` and click **Update Apps List**.
7. **Activate the Add-on:** Use the filter to search for `woocommerce_sync` and activate the add-on.

## Configuration

The add-on is configured through the WooCommerce Sync configuration, accessible via `Home Menu` > `WooCommerce Sync`.

For orders import, two optional mapping logics can be activated. By default, a product and customer (for orders placed by guest customer) placeholder/dummy is created. The options are:

- **Guest Customers Mapping:** When enabled, orders placed by guest (unregistered) customers are matched to existing Odoo customers using their email addresses. If no matching customer exists, a new record is created automatically. When disabled, a customer placeholder (`ref = WooCommerce_Customer_Placeholder`) is assigned to the order.
- **Line Items Product Mapping:** When enabled, each line item is mapped to an existing Odoo product using the `woocommerce_product_id`. If no match is found, a product placeholder is used. When disabled, all order line items are assigned to a placeholder product (`default_code = WooCommerce_Product_Placeholder`) while still displaying the WooCommerce product name. This option is not recommended since product details in WooCommerce may change over time, complicating accurate mapping.
